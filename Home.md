#### Installation


#### Getting Started


#### Building
Building Scratch Blocks requires [Python 2](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and an internet connection as it uses Google's online [Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/). Once you are ready, you can build by running:

```bash
python build.py
```

This will export multiple files including:
```
blockly_uncompressed_vertical.js
blockly_uncompressed_horizontal.js
blockly_compressed_vertical.js
blockly_compressed_horizontal.js
blocks_compressed.js
```
